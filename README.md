# ITSE 476 - PHASE 1
# BookHub
This is an open-source project is aimed at simplifying library operations and improving user satisfaction. Our system is a complete structure that enables users to utilize all features regarding library management in one place. It offers a range of services such as borrowing and returning books, managing user accounts, and searching for titles online. Moreover, the system aids librarians in monitoring stock, handling late items, and creating reports, consequently enhancing the overall effectiveness of library functions.
# Look Around First
We have reviewed a range of projects similar to our own, but our main focus is on enhancing the functionality of our project by addressing the missing features in other projects and making it the most efficient, effective, and useful project.
# Start From What You Have
The BookHub system is set to become an open-source and free platform, based on the contributors of the original Library Management System developed for the course ITSE305 (Software Engineering Project Management). Now that the system has been substantially constructed, it is time to transition to an "open source software" platform and define the appropriate license. In our system, key enhancements will focus on features such as book cataloging, user management, and loan tracking. By optimizing notifications, appointment scheduling, and inventory management, the new BookHub system will prioritize improving user experience and customer service.
# Choose a Good Name
Choosing a name for the project was simple, but it had to be easy to remember and read, and it should explain what its purpose
Our group members determined that everyone give a name that they believe will help the project, and the one that everyone agrees on will be our project name and one of the names was 'BookStore,OpenBook,BookLine' etc 
BookHub was the most agreed on name that is unique and easy to remember.
# State That the Project is Free
BookHub is a free open-source project with a user-friendly interface. The platform is open to all users and developers, encouraging collaboration and innovation. Key features will include book cataloging, user administration, and loan tracking, all with the goal of increasing library operations and user pleasure. The system will be accessible to users, librarians, developers, and library staff.
