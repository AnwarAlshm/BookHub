        <h2>Discover BookHub</h2>
        <p>
            BookHub is an open-source project aimed at simplifying library operations and improving user satisfaction. Our system is a complete structure that enables users to utilize all features regarding library management in one place. It offers a range of services such as borrowing and returning books, managing user accounts, and searching for titles online. Moreover, the system aids librarians in monitoring stock, handling late items, and creating reports, consequently enhancing the overall effectiveness of library functions.
        </p>

        <h3>Look Around First</h3>
        <p>
            We have reviewed a range of projects similar to our own, but our main focus is on enhancing the functionality of our project by addressing the missing features in other projects and making it the most efficient, effective, and useful project.
        </p>

        <h3>Start From What You Have</h3>
        <p>
            The BookHub system is set to become an open-source and free platform, based on the contributors of the original Library Management System developed for the course ITSE305 (Software Engineering Project Management). Now that the system has been substantially constructed, it is time to transition to an "open source software" platform and define the appropriate license. In our system, key enhancements will focus on features such as book cataloging, user management, and loan tracking. By optimizing notifications, appointment scheduling, and inventory management, the new BookHub system will prioritize improving user experience and customer service.
        </p>

        <h3>Choose a Good Name</h3>
        <p>
            Choosing a name            for the project was simple, but it had to be easy to remember and read, and it should explain what its purpose. Our group members determined that everyone give a name that they believe will help the project, and the one that everyone agrees on will be our project name. One of the names was 'BookStore, OpenBook, BookLine', etc. BookHub was the most agreed on name that is unique and easy to remember.
        </p>

        <h3>State That the Project is Free</h3>
        <p>
            BookHub is a free open-source project with a user-friendly interface. The platform is open to all users and developers, encouraging collaboration and innovation. Key features will include book cataloging, user administration, and loan tracking, all with the goal of increasing library operations and user pleasure. The system will be accessible to users, librarians, developers, and library staff.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How do I borrow or return a book?</strong> To borrow or return a book, simply log in to your account, search for the book you want, and follow the instructions to complete the process. For returning, visit the "My Loans" section and follow the return procedure.</li>
            <li><strong>Why do I need to provide my email address when signing up?</strong> Your email is required for account confirmation and notifications regarding book loans, returns, and due dates. This helps ensure smooth communication between users and the library.</li>
            <li><strong>How do I check the availability of a book?</strong> To check if a book is available, use the search function on the platform and look for the availability status displayed next to the title. If the book is currently borrowed, you can reserve it for when it becomes available.</li>
            <li><strong>Can I extend my loan if I need the book for longer?</strong> Yes, you can extend your loan period if the book is not requested by another user. Go to your account, find the book in your "My Loans" section, and select the option to renew it.</li>

            Developer documentation is typically written by developers and is aimed at those with programming experience. Its purpose is to guide other programmers in understanding and working with the codebase. While it includes technical details, it also focuses on collaborative aspects, helping developers navigate the code and contribute effectively. For the BookHub project, wikis will be used to structure and organize all developer-related information. You can find the developer documentation within the design documents.
        </p>

        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <p>
            The BookHub system will be hosted on:
